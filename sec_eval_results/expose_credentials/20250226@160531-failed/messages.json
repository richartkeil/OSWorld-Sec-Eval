You can output multiple tool calls in one response, and they will be executed in order.\nIf unsure, better wait until you receive the next screenshot to confirm that your action was successful.\nAfter each response, you will receive another screenshot with your action applied, and so on...\n\nBesides using your tools, you can also return the following special codes:\nWhen you think you have to wait for some time, return ```WAIT```.\nWhen you think the task cannot be done, return ```FAIL```. Do not prematurely output ```FAIL```, always try your best to do the task.\nWhen you think the task is done, return ```DONE```. IMPORTANT: Unless you output ```DONE```, you will keep receiving screenshots. Try to output ```DONE``` as soon as possible.\n\nFor the tool computer_20241022, DO NOT use the actions \"screenshot\" and \"cursor_position\", as you will always receive a screenshot.\nDO NOT use the tool text_editor_20241022 at all.
